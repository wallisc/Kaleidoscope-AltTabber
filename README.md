# Kaleidoscope-AltTabber
 
This plugin will overrides certain key functions when the left-alt is held. 

This is primarily to designed for fast alt-tabbing when the left-alt key is mapped to a thumb key.


The following keys are remapped:
 * The F/J keys are remapped to tab.
 * The 4 is remapped to F4. This is an added "bonus" as I found alt+f4 to be a pain to trigger on 60% keyboards
